//: Question Context/Category: Closest Node in a Binary Search Tree
//:	Problem: Given a binary search trea and a value of k, please find a node in the binary search tree whose value is closest to k.
//: Question Source: http://codercareer.blogspot.com/2013/03/no-45-closest-node-in-binary-search-tree_2.html?m=1


//: Question Checklist
//: Input will be of int
//: Determine the close value to the input into the function
//: Determine Data structure - assuming the data set is a sorted array?
//: Assumptions, lets say input value is 29, the closest value is 28 in the tree
//: Define closest distance? For example if the next node is 30, the distance to 29 is 1 (30-29), or 27 node this distance will be 2 (29-27)
